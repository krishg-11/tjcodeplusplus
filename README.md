Hi! This is my submission for the Code++ Website! I made use of Flask (which I was new to), HTML, CSS, and JS

The required libraries and imports are listed in the requirements.txt file.

To run the program, just install the necessary libraries and run "python app.py"

Things left for the officers to finish the website:
- Add a short intro on the home page
- Add information to the about section
- Add questions and answers to the FAQ section and add more questions if necessary
- Replace the pictures of leadership with actual pictures
- If you hover over the picture of each officer, you can see social media pop ups which you can add links for
- You can edit the existing lecture info by editing the HTML and changing links
- To add more lectures, just copy the existing tr blocks and change whatever is necessary
- I picked some colors that I thought looked nice but you can change the colors, logo, and icon by both changing the CSS and adding new images

Some images:
